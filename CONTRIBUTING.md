Contributing
============

Our goal with this project is to build a simple, fast, and secure component that you can trust. We
have scoped the project deliberately to address common use cases easily, and made it extensible so
it'll handle exotic use cases too.

Keeping the project small and stable limits our ability to accept new contributors. We are not
seeking new committers at this time, but some small contributions are welcome.

If you've found a bug, please contribute a failing test case so we can study and fix it.

If you have a new feature idea, please build it in an external library. There are
[many libraries][works_with_okhttp] that sit on top or hook in via existing APIs. If you build
something that integrates with OkHttp, tell us so that we can link it!


No Generative Tools
-------------------

We don't use LLMs or generative tools in our source code or documentation. We don't use them for
human-to-human communication in commits, issues, and pull requests. We believe writing is thinking,
and want our work to be thoughtful.

We require all contributors to do likewise. Building is more fun when everyone is making an effort.

We’ll immediately reject LLM-generated contributions to protect the culture of our project. We ban
repeat offenders.

Some narrow exceptions to this policy:

* Non-English speakers may use machine translation tools if they are disclosed.
* Local autocomplete. (Avoid tools that are metered in tokens.)

Coding is fun.


Code Contributions
------------------

Get working code on a personal branch with tests passing before you submit a PR:

```
./gradlew clean check
```

Please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as
readable as possible.

Contribute code changes through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request. We
squash all pull requests on merge.


Gradle Setup
------------

```
$ cat local.properties
sdk.dir=PATH_TO_ANDROID_HOME/sdk
org.gradle.caching=true
```

Running Android Tests
